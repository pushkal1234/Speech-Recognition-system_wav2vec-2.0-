            "GOOD EVENING THIS IS THE THIRTY SEVENTH TIME I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU FROM THIS OFFICE WHERE SO MANY DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE THAT SHAPED THE HISTORY OF THIS NATION EACH TIME I HAVE DONE SO TO DISCUSS WITH YOU SOME MATTER THAT I BELIEVE EFFECTED THE NATIONAL INTEREST IN ALL THE DECISIONS I HAVE MADE IN MY PUBLIC LIFE I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO DO WHAT WAS BEST FOR THE NATION THROUGHOUT THE LONG AND DIFFICULT PERIOD OF WATIGATE I HAVE FELT IT WAS MY DUTY TO PERSEVERE TO MAKE EVERY POSSIBLE EFFORT TO COMPLETE THE TERM OF OFFICE TO WHICH YOU ELECTED ME IN THE BAST FEW DAYS HOWEVER IT HAS BECOME EVIDENT TO ME THAT I NO LONGER HAVE A STRONG ENOUGH POLITICAL BASE IN THE CONGRESS TO JUSTIFY CONTINUING THAT EFFORTAS LONG AS THERE WAS SUCH A BASE I FELT STRONGLY THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO SEE THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION THAT TO DO OTHERWISE WOULD BE UNFAITHFUL TO THE SPIRIT OF THAT DELIBERATELY DIFFICULT PROCESS AND A DANGEROUSLY DESTABLIZING PRECEDENT FOR THE FUTURE BUT WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THAT BASE I NOW BELIEVE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE HAS BEEN SERVED AND THERE IS NO LONGER A NEED FOR THE PROCESS TO BE PROLONGED I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO CARRY THROUGH TO THE FINISH WHATEVER THE PERSONAL AGONY IT WOULD HAVE INVOLVED AND MY FAMILY UNANIMOUSLY URGE ME TO DO SO BUT THE INTERESTS OF THE NATION MUST ALWAYS COME BEFORE ANY PERSONAL CONSIDERATIONS FROM THE DISCUSSIONS I HAVE HAD WITH CONGRESSIONAL AND OTHER LEADERS I HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BECAUSE OF THE UATIGATE MATTER I MIGHT NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE CONGRESS THAT I WOULD

TIME WITH PROBLEMS WE FACE AT HOME AND ABROAD TO CONTINUE TO FIGHTOUGH THE MONTHS AHEAD FOR MY PERSONAL VINDICATION WOULD ALMOST TOTALLY ABSORB THE TIME AND ATTENTION OF BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND THE

WHEN I NOMINATE HIM FOR THAT OFFICE TEN MONTHS AGO THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF AMERICA WILL BE IN GOOD HANDS IN PASSING THIS OFFICE TO THE VICE PRESIDENT I ALSO DO SO WITH A PROFOUND SENSE OF THE WEIGHT OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT WILL FALL ON HIS SHOULDERS TO MORROW AND THEREFORE OF THE UNDERSTANDING THE PATIENCE THE CO OPERATION HE WILL NEED FROM ALL AMERICANS AS HE ASSUMES THAT RESPONSIBILITY HE WILL DESERVE THE HELP AND THE SUPPORT OF ALL OF US AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE THE FIRST ESSENTIAL IS TO BEGIN HEALING THE WOUNDS OF THIS NATION TO PUT THE BITTERNESS AND DIVISIONS OF THE RECENT PAST BEHIND US AND TO REDISCUVER THOSE SHARED IDEALS THAT LIETH THE HEART OF OUR STRENGTH AND UNITY AS A GRAVE AND AS A FREE PEOPLE BY TAKING THIS ACTION I HOPE THAT I WILL HAVE HASTENED THE START OF THAT PROCESS OF HEALI WHICH IS SO DESPERATELY NEEDED IN AMERICA I REGRET DEEPLY ANY INJURIES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENTS THAT LED TO THIS DECISION I WOULD SAY ONLY THAT IF SOME OF MY
